# dwm-jv

an build of suckless's dwm. It's Pretty much Luke Smith's build with different colors and text icons instead of emojis. Also has the pertag and attachasideandbelow patches. Beware as there is a few binds to some of his scripts on the config.h file, so without them it's just a wasted keybind.

Obs: I use sxhkd for almost every non-wm related keybind, that's why this build has not a lot of binds.
